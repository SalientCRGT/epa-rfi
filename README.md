## HapiGen 

HapiGen is an application built with the EPA’s developers in mind.  The idea came to us while reviewing the available datasets from developer.epa.gov.  We noticed that the majority were in csv or xml format, which are both older, bulkier, and less versatile data interchange formats than the modern JSON format.  We saw an opportunity: in order to make it easier for EPA developers to make great applications with these datasets, they needed to be in a lighter, more adaptable format.  Converting datasets from csv to JSON is a great first step to help developers create applications from this data.  We made a scalable version of this vision with HapiGen – a JSON API generator for the Facilities Registry System’s dataset.  We wanted to do more for this RFI than simply pick a dataset to redisplay with fancy graphics.  We wanted to show that <u>SalientCRGT(link to company info)<\u> creates and maintains outstanding software applications by thinking outside of the box to solve real world problems for our clients.  Our organization has a <u>long history(link to EPA relationship)<\u> of creating comprehensive software solutions for the EPA, and we hope that this proposal proves our desire to grow that relationship with such an important agency.

While the current version of this application is limited in scope to the FRS dataset and its csv files, we could easily expand its scope to incorporate multiple datasets and additional file formats.  An additional feature we would like to add is search operators, to make advanced searching even easier.

In order to accomplish this task, our <u>dedicated team(link to team story)<\u> of developers worked in a centralized <u>agile war room(picture)<\u> in the afternoons, and met for twice daily standups.  We utilized <u>Slack (screenshot)<\u> for group messaging, and the <u>Waffle.io board (screenshot)<\u>  in combination with Github to track stories and bugs.  <u>Cloud9 (screenshot)<\u> was our development environment, and our application is hosted in the <u>AWS cloud (screenshot?)<\u>.
