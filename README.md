Our concept:
The EPA has a great deal of datasets that are in CSV, XML, or other older file formats.  Our concept is to take a dataset in CSV format from the EPA and create a table with that data that will allow our application to convert the files to JSON.  The web application will provide a simple search functionality, and then display the results.  We will also include an upload feature so the EPA can utilize our application to upload the latest data and have it get converted and displayed automatically.
