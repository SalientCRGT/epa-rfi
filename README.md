## Hapi-Gen 

HapiGen is an application built with the EPA’s developers in mind.  The idea came to us while reviewing the available datasets from developer.epa.gov.  We noticed that the majority were in csv or xml format, which are both older, bulkier, and less versatile data interchange formats than the modern JSON format.  We saw an opportunity: in order to make it easier for EPA developers to make great applications with these datasets, they needed to be in a lighter, more adaptable format.  Converting datasets from csv to JSON is a great first step to help developers create applications from this data.  We made a scalable version of this vision with HapiGen – a JSON API generator for the Facilities Registry System’s dataset.  We wanted to do more for this RFI than simply pick a dataset to redisplay with fancy graphics.  We wanted to show that SalientCRGT creates and maintains outstanding software applications by thinking outside of the box to solve real world problems for our clients.

While the current version of this application is limited in scope to the FRS dataset and its csv files, we could easily expand its scope to incorporate multiple datasets and additional file formats.  An additional feature we would like to add is search operators, to make advanced searching even easier.

In order to accomplish this task, our dedicated team of developers worked in a centralized agile war room in the afternoons, and met for twice daily standups.  We utilized Slack for group messaging, and the Waffle.io board in combination with Github to track stories and bugs.  Cloud9 was our development environment, and our application is hosted in the AWS cloud.
